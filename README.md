## üìÑ Abstract
This study explores blockchain technology's potential to revolutionize the traditional housing rental system. Various issues, including information asymmetry, false property listings, insufficient rental agreement protection, and personal data breaches, plague the current rental market. 
In response to these challenges, this study conducts an in-depth review of ten pertinent academic publications, focusing on the architectural design, founda-tional technologies, and prospective benefits of decentralized rental platforms powered by blockchain.
The findings indicate that the immutability, transparency, and decentralization characteristics of blockchain can significantly enhance the credibility of rental information and prevent fraudulent listings. Additionally, smart contracts ena-ble the automatic execution of rental agreement terms, thereby improving transaction efficiency and reducing reliance on intermediary services.
This study focuses on the application of multiple blockchain technologies within rental systems. Decentralized Identity (DID) solutions are highlighted for their ability to securely manage and verify identities and related credentials, thus mitigating the risk of personal information leakage and fostering trust be-tween landlords and tenants. Furthermore, the research evaluates the suitability and performance of the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform in rental scenarios.
The analysis reveals that blockchain-based rental systems offer significant ad-vantages, including increased market transparency, enhanced transaction security, reduced fraud risk, and streamlined dispute resolution processes. Using immutable records on the blockchain provides both parties with more reliable guarantees. Moreover, integrating non-fungible tokens (NFTs) shows potential for certifying property ownership and enabling identity tracking.
However, the study also identifies several practical challenges facing imple-menting blockchain-based rental systems. These include technological com-plexity and adoption barriers, the need for legal and regulatory adaptation, concerns regarding personal data privacy and compliance (e.g., with GDPR), and scalability and performance limitations of blockchain platforms. Another critical issue is finding a balance between the immutability of blockchain and the necessity for legitimate data corrections or updates.
Finally, based on the current analysis and discussion, this study proposes future research directions in blockchain-based rental systems. These include the development of more mature and user-friendly decentralized identity solutions, improvements in blockchain performance and cost-efficiency, enhanced security verification of smart contracts, optimization of user experience, and integration with emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Overall, blockchain technology offers powerful tools for improving the housing rental market's efficiency, transparency, and security. Despite existing challenges, it holds great promise for reshaping the future rental ecosystem.
